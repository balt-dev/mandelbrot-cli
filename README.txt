I just made this to dip my toes in the water of C, metaphorically speaking. 
This code is probably extremely bad, but it's my first time, so...

Run this from the command line. An example command would be:
C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Downloads>mandelbrot 2048 32 0 0 2 mandel.png

libattopng.c and libattopng.h are from https://github.com/misc0110/libattopng.
